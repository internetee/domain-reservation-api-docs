    API for managing domain name registration and reservation in the business registry.
    
    Key features:
    - Domain name reservation
    - Retrieval of registration codes for reserved domains
    - Status checks for reserved domains
    
    Important: The registration code obtained through this API is essential for completing 
    the domain registration process with authorized registrars. This code serves as a 
    password and should be kept confidential until provided to the chosen registrar.

    Note: Access to all endpoints in this API is restricted to authorized IP addresses only.
    Some endpoints additionally require a custom token for authentication.
